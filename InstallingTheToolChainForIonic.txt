Install Command Line Tools

In order to install Homebrew, you need to install either the Xcode Command Line Tools (about 100 MB) or the full Xcode package (about 10 GB). 

Command Line Tools gives Mac users many commonly used tools, utilities, and compilers. One advantage of this is that when you install Command Line Tools, it installs Git which you need as Homebrew is essentially all Git and Ruby scripts underneath.

Start by using the FINDER to navigate to the Application Folder, and then Utlities.

Open the TERMINAL

Install xCode Command line Tools:

xcode-select --install

Check if Command Line Tools is installed by entering at the Terminal Prompt:

xcode-select -p

Install Homebrew
Open a terminal and type the command below. Youâ€™ll be prompted to give your password, which is usually the one that you also use to unlock your Mac when you start it up. After you enter your password, the installation will start.

/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"


Next, install git using BREW
